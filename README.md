# cable-detection-svm

Cable detection using SVM (Support Vector Machine) I did when attending Machine Vision class in my college

Run Data_Collect to collect images of objects that are suspected to be cables. 

Press 0 to skip said image 

Press 1 to classify said image as cable

Press 2 to classify said image as non-cable


Run Detect_Kabel to see the cable detection

LBP_SVM_DetectKabel is a program that uses LBP (Local Binary Pattern) for Line Detection
